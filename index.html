      <h2>Why Cold Pressed Oil?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When oils are heated, their molecular structure is compromised,
          creating carcinogenic free radicals. Oils that are heated, when
          ingested, can contribute to cardiovascular disease and difficulty of
          the blood to efficiently transport oxygen.
